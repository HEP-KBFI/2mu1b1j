# Important files and their purpose

In this part of the documentation will be described how to set up your custom analysis.

For that you need to know:

1. Location of data
2. Contents of your data (is it Monte Carlo or observed? What parameters are available?)
3. Cuts you have to apply (thresholds for filtering signal from the background)
4. In which files of the software you specify location of the data and where you apply the cuts

Only point 4 is in the scope of this documentation.



## How I run the tests?

Before doing anything you have to set up your environment variables, use commands:

```bash
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
cd /home/YOUR_USERNAME/VHbbNtuples_7_6_x/CMSSW_7_6_3/src/
cmsenv
python tthAnalysis/HiggsToTauTau/test/NtupleList.py
```

```bash
python test/tthAnalyzeRun_3l_1tau.py
```

Imports files:

* python/tthAnalyzeSamples_3l_1tau.py
* python/analyzeConfig_3l_1tau.py



## How to I specify the cuts?

There usually are cuts in your observed or MC data. This paragraph describes,
how to add additional cuts.

If you want to have a custom analyze, you have to duplicate those files and
modify their logic:


### test/tthAnalyzeRun_3l_1tau.py

* What histograms are generated and in which file stored
* Defines input parameters for analyzeConfig_3l_1tau
* Sets C++ executable (executable_analyze = "analyze_3l_1tau" (bin/analyze_3l_1tau.cc)


### python/tthAnalyzeSamples_3l_1tau.py
tightMuonSelector
* Exports a samples variable of type OrderedDict (basically a simple structure, a Hash (also known as a Map)).
* May include samples from other "*Samples*.py" files in python directory. In which case triggers file be iteratively overwritten to match particular scenario.


### test/analyzeConfig_3l_1tau.py

* defines analyzeConfig_3l_1tau
* includes definition for analyzeConfig_3l_1tau class, that extends test/analyseConfig.py (with a bad style? http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm)
* defines what data to use (python/tthAnalyzeSamples_3l_1tau.py)


### C++ executable: bin/analyze_3l_1tau.cc

* uses config generated by analyzeConfig_3l_1tau#analyzeConfig_3l_1tau (inputs files etc)
* loads selected data into histograms (from raw file)
* defines really complicated filters (for cutting data)
* uses BDT for selecting events from raw data
